# Machine Learning Task -01

## House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
Predicting house prices is a common and challenging problem in the field of real estate and finance. In this blog, we will guide you through the process of building a machine learning model to predict house prices using the House Price Prediction Dataset. We will cover data preparation, data visualization, feature analysis, model building, and model evaluation to help you achieve accurate predictions.

### Task Overview
#### Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict house prices using the House Price Prediction Dataset.

## Task Execution
### 1. Data Preparation
#### Data Loading
Start by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. This allows us to manipulate and explore the data efficiently.
#### Data visualization
To better understand the data, use visualization libraries like Matplotlib to create bar plots and other visualizations of data features. This step can provide insights into the distribution of features and help identify patterns

### 2. Feature Analysis
#### Corelation Analysis
To gain insights into the dataset, use Seaborn or any other visualization library to explore the correlation between features. This can help you identify which features are most strongly correlated with the target variable, in this case, house prices.

### 3. Building the Machine Learning Model
After understanding the dataset, itâ€™s time to build a machine learning model.

### 4. Model Evaluation and Fine-Tuning
After building the initial model, evaluate its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared. These metrics will help you understand how well your model is performing. If the results are not satisfactory, consider fine-tuning the model by adjusting hyperparameters or trying different algorithms.

### 5. Conclusion
Concluding the project.
